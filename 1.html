            <br>
            <u><b>Explain it like I'm 5: </b></u>
            <p>At it's simplest form, a blockchain is like a global spreadsheet of transactions. Nobody can edit existing transactions, but anyone can add a new one</p>
            <br>
            <u><b>The internet's law of ownership:</b></u>
            <p>Turns out, blockchain is a great tool for verifying the owner of digital things. Which means the whole concept of owning something digitally can exist. Which is crazy and mind bending, but here we are.</p>
            <br>
            <u><b>New frontiers:</b></u>
            <p>We're true believers that digital ownership will have profound impacts on how we use the internet, build communities, and reconcile our value to existing platforms. There's an entire new world of creation, ownership and monetization coming, and it can be truly overwhelming. Dehidden is built to help you experiment with ideas today, and navigate the new world coming.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Blockchain tokens can be sorted into two distinct types of assets: fungible and non-fungible. Fungible tokens are identical and replaceable by another identical token; they are mutually interchangeable. They can represent anything from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and coins used in a video game to tokenized versions of real-world assets like crude oil or gold.</p>
            <p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique, and thus not interchangeable.</p>
            <p>A digital art piece that you created, an ownership certificate of a car, or a character in a game are examples of non-fungible assets—they are unique and not directly interchangeable.</p>
            <p>In 2017, the NFT industry market cap was measured at just over $30 million. 2018 was notably a down year for the blockchain industry as a whole, but the NFT market cap rose by 480%, weighing in at $180 million. In 2019 the market cap rose again, ending the year at roughly $220 million. NFT transactions tripled in 2020, reaching more than $250 million in total. In just the first two months of 2021, NFT trading volume topped $342 million, surpassing the volume of the entire last year.</p>
            <p>NFTs have rapidly gained popularity among companies, artists, celebrities, and influencers as a way to digitize their brands, with early 2021 seeing over 630,000 distinct Ethereum wallets that have created NFTs.</p>

            <p>Blockchain Industry Overview:</p>
            <br>
            <b>The Urge for Killer dApps in the Blockchain Space</b>
            <p>Even though the digital asset universe endured a difficult year in 2018, it has since then been on a significant surge. The global blockchain market is forecasted to continuously grow from USD$ 1.2 billion in 2018 to USD$ 23.3 billion by 2023, at a CAGR of 80.2% (this is on track and accelerated as of 2021)</p>
            <br>
            <p>The blockchain ecosystem can be classified into three categories:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Blockchain platforms:</b> blockchain mainnets as platforms like Ethereum, EOS and NEO.</li>
                <li><b>Middleware protocols:</b> protocols as middleware to help applications communicate -
                    read, write, store, and manage data - with blockchains at an infrastructure level, like
                    IPFS and HyperLedger.</li>
                <li><b>DApps:</b> decentralized applications interacting with blockchains instead of traditional
                    centralized databases, like Crypto Kitties and decentralized exchanges.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>Blockchain platforms are core platforms where other things can be built and middleware protocols are blockchain protocols which govern the execution of program code - common transactions required from various applications or enterprises. The two are often referred to as infrastructure protocols in contrast to dApps, which are high-level services operating autonomously with their smart-contract-based systems. DApps are one of the main features of Ethereum along with smart contracts: a combination of different technologies to provide their users specific functionalities.</p>
            <img src="./Blockchain_Evolution.png" alt="" style="width: 60vw; height: 60vh">
            <br>
            <p>To allow the new technology of blockchain to be adopted, the first step needed was infrastructure support and now the next step is user engagement. We are of the view that the key to adoption lies in dApps which engage directly with end users. That is why we are presently seeing a huge urge from platform players as well as institutional investors on the scene for killer dApps.</p>

            <li style="font-size: x-large;"><p style="background-color: thistle;">Problem: Access</p></li>
            <br>
            <b>The Internet’s Original Sin</b>
            <p>The internet is a monumental, state-funded invention that omitted the ability to transfer value over a digitally native <b>P2P Value transfer protocol. Information could be transferred cheaply, but not its underlying value.</b> Subsequently, tremendous value accrued to centralized gatekeepers who could throttle bandwidth and impact information flows at will, due to their massive distribution networks and gated privileges. For the past 50 years, our creative class was sacrificed at the altar of efficiency and scale. Media consumption increased but content creators who would not buckle to established orders were told to ‘learn to code’.</p>
            <p>And that is exactly what they did.</p>
            <p>
                According to State of the dApps, although there are currently over 2,000 dApps on the
                market, they only have a daily active use (“DAU”) of 55K, with the most active dApps being
                decentralized exchanges like IDEX, 0x, and Bancor, followed by game dApps. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Considering token sales and venture capital have raised over USD$38 billion which has been
                invested in blockchain projects over the past 3.5 years, the real-use adoption in the sector is
                extremely low - at a higher level, almost nothing has happened yet. Compared to the recently
                buzzing Pokemon Go case - a single mobile game title, with only a 1.2% of capital input, the
                startup reported that their monthly active users (“MAU”) broke the 140 million level in 2018:
                a much higher record than the total digital asset wallet adoptions and the capital investment raised was below the USD$1 billion level.

                Furthering this thesis, Dapps would have value realized from Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) but have faced implementational roadblocks. Buying NFTs should be easy. It's far from it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Why shouldn’t buying NFTs be as easy as buying a t-shirt or in-game items with your UPI ID? Why shouldn’t selling one as part of a brand be as easy as setting up a Shopify store?
            </p>
            <p>
                NFTs represent one of the most exciting evolutions of the internet. Over the last several months, millions of consumers have been introduced to NFTs and the entirely new ownership structures they unlock for digital goods. NFTs represent a key building block of the metaverse. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Though the ecosystem has come a long way in a very short time, it still takes a fair amount of work for brands to participate. The list of things for brands to figure out and build is long: building custom storefront experiences and payment mechanisms, helping customers set up various wallets and crypto transfers, handling the web traffic spikes that often follow popular NFT drops

            <li style="font-size: x-large;"><p style="background-color: thistle;">Solution</p></li>
            <p>Dehidden lets creators, brands, and platforms easily create, sell, and purchase NFTs — no crypto deep dive required. How do we do this? For starters, We're building:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Storefronts on Dehidden, so creators can create and sell NFTs directly to their audience</li>
                <li>A digital wallet designed for mass market adoption, making it easy to buy NFTs with just your credit card, Debit card or UPI ID</li>
                <li>A developer dApp platform for custom Immersion & Intelligence </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Consider how a platform like Shopify has empowered any merchant, be it a small store or a large brand, to easily set up a commerce experience online. Dehidden brings the same leverage to anyone wanting to sell NFTs online. Dehidden also gives these brands and creators the option to sell their NFTs through their own existing channels.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Dehidden's solution revolves around 3 pillars: Phygitals, Intelligence, Immersion </p>
            <p>While building the NFT & dApp system around the said functions, we're focusing on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Intuitive: Making buying an NFT in India laughably simple</li>
                <li>Intelligent: Making the NFT an unlock of constant value through it's lifecycle</li>
                <li>Immersive: Presenting the NFT as a store of identity for the creator and the brand</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Gaming dApps as Catalyst for Blockchain Mass Adoption</p>
            <p>
                The global blockchain market is expected to rapidly grow to USD$ 23.3 billion by 2023, even
                though the digital asset market went through a long winter in 2018 and early 2019. Today, a
                problem facing the blockchain industry lies in user engagement; that is, it has a desperate
                need for a successful mass-adoption use case to prove that the blockchain industry can be
                sustainable and that it can provide an economically healthy token model for the long run.
                Therefore there is a huge urge from platform players as well as institutional investors and
                blockchain service players in the value chain, for killer decentalized applications (“dApps”).
            </p>
            <p>
                Dehidden believes that gaming dApps will act as a catalyst for blockchain mass adoption
                through its integration of blockchains and the ever-rising PC online/mobile gaming industry.
                Our team is writing a new playbook for experiences that are immersive and intelligent on blockchain, combining our online/mobile experiences standards with new technical advances.

            <br>
            <p>Phygitals are the convergence of the physical and digital world. This means that each physical product comes with a digital identity called a Non-Fungible Token (NFT). NFTs contain unique information that is stored on the blockchain.</p>
            <p>Dehidden has built one of the worlds simplest implementation of Tokens tied to physical objects. To claim digital ownership of a phygital, simply scan the Real Items smart label on the product with your phone. Input the one-time pin and gain immediate access to the product’s unique information.</p>
            <img src="./Phygitals.png" alt="" style="height: 60vh; width: 60vw;">
            <p>Phygitals are the future of great customer experience. They were mostly used at the height of the pandemic when people had to accomplish usual tasks such as grocery shopping digitally. In a time when people were encouraged to stay at home, phygitals gave customers the best components of digital retail experience like immediacy and immersion. Phygitals provide the perfect combination of security and convenience.</p>
            <p>Real Items phygitals are secure because they are backed/secured by blockchain technology. This means that all products have proof of origin and can be traced for authenticity. Phygitals are also convenient because they give consumers direct access to customer service.</p>
            <br>
            <b><u>Why pair NFTs with Real Items?</u></b>
            <p>For consumers - It's the gateway drug to the metaverse.</p>
            <p>It provides a familiar sense of buying 'something' whilst introducing them to a whole new world in NFTs.</p>
            <p>Dehidden's Real Items gives consumers access to a phygital’s digital identity or NFT using a smart label. These smart labels are like Serialized QR codes but secured using blockchain technology, making them tamper-proof. Real Items have Dehidden smart labels adhere to industry 4.0 standards. After scanning a label and taking digital ownership of a phygital, the owner will be redirected to the Real Items app; no downloads required.</p>
            <p>The Real Items app allows customers to  <b> store, buy, and sell NFTs.</b> For payments, the app lets you connect your bank account or credit card to <b>add cash or ETH </b> in the wallet section. Lastly, the app includes customer support for <b>direct and accessible communication with Real Items representatives.</b></p>
            <p>If you have a supply chain, a Shopify store, or an original brand, Real Items will allow you to easily create NFTs using the Tokenized Asset Manager (TAM).</p>
            <p>TAM’s intuitive and easy-to-use design allows managers and store owners to create smart labels and batches of digital identities for each phygital. TAM enables enterprises to manage real-time inventory distribution and check their products’ global analytics. Additionally, TAM includes a direct line of communication with customers’ data analysis and metrics.</p>
            <br>
            <b><u>How does real items blockchain technology work?</u></b>
            <p>Real items are products with matching digital certificates of authenticity. These records are immutable, non fungible and universally tradeable.</p>
            <p>Brands start by creating a digital identity for the products they sell.  Brands can use our Shopify App or our cloud application/API to create digital identities and apply them to packaging or products. Then consumers can scan the 2fa QR code to verify the product authenticity.</p>
            <p>For Shopify store owners using the Dehidden Items Shopify App, their users will be sent their NFT directly into their real items account. They can double check the same product arrives when they scan the matching 2fa QR code.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><u>You collect NFT's in your real items portfolio.</u></b>
            <p>This makes it easy to locate product information at a later date.  If a product is matched to a cause, you will receive follow up information within your portfolio.</p>
